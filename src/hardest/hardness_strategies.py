class FastScoreSamplingHardnessCalculation(UnsupervisedHardnessCalculation):
    """
    A highly efficient alternative to ScoreSamplingHardness which avoids association of ground truth and detections.

    Can be targeted to some specific hardness definitions without actually calling the hardness definition function.

    False negatives and false positives are computed by assuming that the sampled pseudo ground truth will always
    associate to the detection from which it was generated, and hence the expensive association algorithm can be
    avoided.

            "fn" (false negatives) or "false".
        weighting_fn: Weighting function to be used for boxes in evaluation when computing hardness.
            See hardest.pycocotools.weightings for more details.
        score_threshold: The detector score threshold (proposed detections with a score greater than this are
            are considered confirmed).
        reduction: Reduction function to be applied to samples of hardness, i.e. np.mean will yield expectation.
            A combination of np.mean and np.std can be used to obtain a lower bound
